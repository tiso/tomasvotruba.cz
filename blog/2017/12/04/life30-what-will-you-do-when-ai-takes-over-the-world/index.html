                Do you remember cell phones? Those that could only call and send SMS. I bought a Nokia phone that could <strong>also play mp3s</strong> when I was 14 years old.
Who would have thought <strong>we could play movies and use internet on those phones</strong> just 10 years later.

Artificial Intelligence is now in same level as mobile phones playing mp3s. Or <strong>maybe it already took over the world without knowing us</strong>, as <em>Life 3.0</em> story unveils...

<p>Daniel Pink in one of his <a href="http://www.danpink.com/pinkcast/">PinkCast</a> (the best value/time  deal vlogs I know, just ~ 2 minutes) shared a link to book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-3-0-Being-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1101946598">Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</a> by Max Tegmark.</p>
<p>Few more people liked it too, so why not give it a try:</p>

<p>Until then I only thought about artificial intelligence <strong>from Maths and Psychology point of view</strong>, which is great combination but merely enough to understand the topic properly. This book is mix of fiction, utopia, dystopia, number of researches, <strong>with focus on beneficial intelligence</strong>.</p>

<p>The book made me think really hard. I tried to answer questions that never occur relevant to me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How I want to focus my career in world, where human tasks get more and more automated?</strong></li>
<li>How I want to <strong>raise my child to be adaptable</strong> in the future?</li>
</ul>
<p>I love this part of book:</p>
<p>&quot;What career advice <em>should</em> we give to our kids? I'm encouraging mine to go into professions that machines are currently bad at, and therefore seem unlikely to get automated in the near future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it require interacting with people and using social intelligence?</li>
<li>Does it involve creativity and coming up with clever solutions?</li>
<li>Does it require working in an unpredictable environment?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-my-takeaways"><a href="#what-are-my-takeaways">What are my Takeaways?</a></h2>
<p>The books states that every field have <strong>parts that can be easily automated and parts that will take some time</strong>.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/life30/job-chart.png" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>And not only in non-IT positions. As a programmer you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>create e-commerce</strong> one after another,</li>
<li>focus on <strong>prediction of nearest next product the customer wants to buy before he knows</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>I found lot of inspiration and possible blind paths for <a href="https://github.com/rectorphp/rector">RectorPHP</a> project. It's <em>narrow intelligence</em>, that upgrades code for you based on your dependencies (I will write about it soon).</p>
<p>If I should apply the same logic as above, <strong>you can be teacher</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>who <strong>explains news and trends in software for last 2 years</strong></li>
<li>or the one who teaches people <strong>how to write a tool, that applies those trends to the code and is usable for next 10 years with minimal work</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>I realized how I underestimate the AI and remembered my (dead) Nokia:</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/life30/nokia-mp3.jpg">
<h3 id="reading-protip"><a href="#reading-protip">Reading Protip!</a></h3>
<p>The 2nd half of the book focuses on future of 100+ years. The main focus for me lies in first part: <strong>where are we now, what could happens soon and how can we prepare</strong>.</p>
<p>So if you read first half, you'll get most of this book. Of course, if you like sci-fi stories of harvesting Saturn into circu-planet colony keep on reading.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
