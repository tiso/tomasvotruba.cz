                I used Scrutinizer for a few years now for code coverage and code quality. Configuration was far complex, some issues appeared and build kept failing. But I really wanted a code quality checker for my open-source projects and this was the best tool available.
<br><br>
But last week I had an issue with simple <code>composer install</code> command and I have had enough. Then <strong>my attention turned to PHPStan</strong>, soon-to-be its replacement.

<h2 id="what-is-phpstan"><a href="#what-is-phpstan">What is PHPStan</a></h2>
<p><strong>PHPStan is a tool for static analysis of PHP code</strong>. It's open source and free to use.
You can read more about it in this post with very true title - <a href="https://medium.com/@ondrejmirtes/phpstan-2939cd0ad0e3">PHPStan: Find Bugs In Your Code Without Writing Tests!</a></p>

<h3 id="it-is-open-source"><a href="#it-is-open-source">It Is Open-Source</a></h3>
<p><strong>I can improve it, I can add an issue, I can see its development</strong>. I can't do anything like that with Scrutinizer. It used to be <a href="https://github.com/scrutinizer-ci/scrutinizer">open-source</a> but got closed. That's was a huge step back.</p>
<h3 id="it-focuses-just-on-php"><a href="#it-focuses-just-on-php">It Focuses Just on PHP</a></h3>
<p><strong>It's a PHP tool that checks PHP code.</strong> Scrutinizer, on the other hand, focuses on various languages - Python, Ruby, soon Java and Scala. That's definitely a good direction, but not if a simple <code>composer install</code> command breaks and is not fixed for months.</p>
<h3 id="i-can-control-it"><a href="#i-can-control-it">I Can Control It</a></h3>
<p>I can use it for private packages. I can download it, extend it in various ways (I can define magic behaviour of my classes) and even write my own checks.</p>
<p>For all these reasons I support <a href="https://www.patreon.com/phpstan">PHPStan on Patreon</a>. Try giving <strong>50 % of your hourly rate</strong> a month. It can make a huge impact on PHP world.</p>

<h3 id="1-disable-scrutinizer-code-rating"><a href="#1-disable-scrutinizer-code-rating">1. Disable Scrutinizer Code Rating</a></h3>
<p>Drop this from <code>.scrutinizer.yml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">checks:

        code_rating: true</code></pre>
<h3 id="2-add-phpstan-dependency"><a href="#2-add-phpstan-dependency">2. Add PHPStan Dependency</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">composer require phpstan/phpstan --dev</code></pre>
<h3 id="3-setup-command-in-code-composer-json-code"><a href="#3-setup-command-in-code-composer-json-code">3. Setup Command in <code>composer.json</code></a></h3>
<p>This step is optional and it might seem weird seeing it for the first time, but I like the united usage (on all different projects and environments).</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
    "scripts": {
        "phpstan": "vendor/bin/phpstan analyse src --level=0"
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now you can run with the same script, even if the settings changes (and it will):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">composer phpstan</code></pre>
<h3 id="4-add-to-code-travis-yml-code"><a href="#4-add-to-code-travis-yml-code">4. Add to <code>travis.yml</code></a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-yml">script:
  - composer phpstan</code></pre>
<p>Commit and... push! Now you are running PHPStan on your open-source project. Congrats!</p>
<h2 id="the-one-thing-i-love-about-phpstan"><a href="#the-one-thing-i-love-about-phpstan">The One Thing I Love About PHPStan</a></h2>
<p>One last thing. You may have noticed the <code>level</code> option. What's that for? PHPStan has now 6 levels (in time of writing this article) - <strong>0 = least strict, 5 = the most strict</strong>.</p>
<p>This allowed me to <strong>put PHPStan to action without any huge work</strong>. I start with level 0, 12 errors were found and fixed them.</p>
<p>Next week, when I'm rested and full of joy, I can go to level 1, fix another 8 errors.</p>
<p>I love this approach over traditional overwhelming &quot;500 errors found. Fix them all or CI will keep failing.&quot;. That usually leads to removing the tool and to very long fixing process. I remember my long night hours with Scrutinizer just to get from code quality from 6 to 10.</p>
<h3 id="try-it-out"><a href="#try-it-out">Try It Out...</a></h3>
<p>...on your open-source or local projects and let me know how you like it.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
